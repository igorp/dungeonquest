Dungeon Quest
======

![alt tag](https://github.com/igorp/random/blob/master/src/dungeonquest/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Dungeon Quest is 2D topdown view game written in Java. You can explore dungeons with the arrow keys and collect gold, but don't get killed! For an extra challenge try getting rid of the rat by attacking it (press the space bar to do so).

All of the code, art and music was made by me. The game consists of several classes with the 'Warrior' class on the top. Maps are stored as separate files and you can also easily modify them using the map editor that comes along (left click to add tile, right click to copy tile).
